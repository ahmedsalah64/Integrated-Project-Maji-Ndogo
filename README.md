# Restoring the lifeblood of Maji Ndogo
At the heart of this project is the **water crisis** faced by a fictitious **country** called **Maji Ndogo**. In this project, I dove deep into the intricacies of **using SQL to solve complex problems.**
This project **progressively challenged** me and offered **less guidance** as I progressed, pushing me to **think critically**. By the end, I didn't just have a **deeper understanding** of **SQL** but also a **blueprint** for how to **approach problems** in future missions.
I completed the **project over the five weeks** of the SQL module.
